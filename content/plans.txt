Well, some may want to make even more changes and customizations to their Windows install, one could use <a href="https://schneegans.de/windows/unattend-generator/">schneegans unattend generator</a> and be perfectly fine with that, but in order to "compete" i might actually need something more powerful, or atleast as powerful as theirs. It may take quite a while before i get there and im not even sure if i will get there (EVER). But one got to try at least :)
